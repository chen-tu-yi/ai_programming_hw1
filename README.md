# Go Fish Canvas Game

This repository contains a single-page implementation of the classic card game **Go Fish** that you can play against the computer. The entire experience is rendered to an HTML5 canvas so it works in any modern browser without extra dependencies.

## Controls & Tips

- Hovering over your cards highlights the rank that will be requested.
- If either player runs out of cards they automatically draw from the pond (deck) when possible.
- The computer uses a simple strategy that favors requesting ranks it already holds the most copies of.

Enjoy the game!
